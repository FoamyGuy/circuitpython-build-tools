This repo contains build scripts used to build the
[Adafruit CircuitPython bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle), [CircuitPython Community bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle)
and individual library release zips on Travis CI.

The pip package includes mpy-crosses that run on Travis. They will likely not
work in other environments.
